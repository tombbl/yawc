h1. yawc is yet another web crawler

*yawc* is a ruby script which uses "Mechanize":http://mechanize.rubyforge.org to crawl the sites.
There are still plenty of things to do to make it more robust.

At this moment it works stable. And that is its main advantage :-)

*yawc* uses OptionParser library and can inform you of the acceptable input switches.
