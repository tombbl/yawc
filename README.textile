h1. yawc is yet another web crawler

*yawc* is a ruby script which uses "Mechanize":http://mechanize.rubyforge.org to crawl the sites.
There are still plenty of things to do to make it more robust.

At this moment it works stable. And that is its main advantage :-)


h1. Changes

h2. Earlier
# yawc emerged from darkness of its author's mind
# had quite a number of code refactoring
# grew with stability improvement and error handling

h2. 2012-02-23
# User can now terminate yawc in a clean manner by hitting Ctrl+c.
# Links are now stored only in absolute form.
